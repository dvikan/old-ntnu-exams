TASK 1


1a)

Informally, if B is true, then each resaturant has the same menu,
which of course is a menu.


1b)

   FA       A:(x): ( R(x) => (E:(y): M(y) & H(x,y)))


   FB       E:(y):  M(y) & (A:(x): R(x) => H(x,y))


FB => FA

1c)       

       Prove   FB => FA by showing that


                (FB & -FA) is inconsistent


1d)

       G2          - R(x) |  H(x,sk1).

Negate  FA and clausify

            -   A:(x): ( R(x) => (E:(y): M(y) & H(x,y))) 

                E:(x): - ( R(x) => (E:(y): M(y) & H(x,y))) 

                E:(x): ( R(x) & - (E:(y): M(y) & H(x,y)))

                E:(x): ( R(x) & (A:(y): -M(y)  | H(x,y)))

                R(sk2) & (A:(y): -M(y)  | -H(sk2,y)))  


1e)

Resolution Proof


       G5       -H(sk2,sk1)    (G1,G4)
       G6       H(sk2,sk1)     (G3,G2)
       G7       []             (G5,G6)



TASK 2



2a)

Et CSP problem er defined by  a 


   - a set of variables

   - a set of domains for these variables

   - a set of constraint relations between the variables


2b)


In the present problem, the variables are the slots in the matrix


We can call them

     PmSdh    Person m, Slot dn (d day, h hour-slot)



The domain for all variables is the  set of activities according to the list:

      A1  Registration
      A2  Information
      A3  Lecture
      A4  Exhibition
      A5  Computer     
            
     Example from the figure


            P1D108 = A1
            P2D108 = A1    P2D110 = A2   P2D214 = A2


2c)


Constraints can now be formulated by examples:

 -    Registration is only open the first morning

(Simplify morning to 08-10 strict, and exactly 6 persons)  

      This is a relation on the variables

        P1D108 , P2D108,  P3D108 , P4D108,  P5D108 , P5D108, 

 The exact formulation shall express that 3 of them must be A1 
           
     The information desk has to be manned at all times

     This is a set of relations for each column (slot)

Example (1. slot)

       P1D108, P2D108  P3D108, P3D108   P5D108, P6D108

The exact formulation shall exprsss that   one of them must be A2

 -   Each lecture needs an assistant in the lecture hall
    ......

 - Computer service once in moring ...

   ........

 - The exhibition needs an assistant ...

   ......

- No assistant shall work more than 1 time slot in a row with the same task

   ......

- One person can only do one activity at a time

    - This is automatically fullfilled, provided the each variable can
      only have one value

2d)

  Backtracking search for CSP


     The most basic method is simply to assign domain varibles to
     possible domain values at a time, test the constraints and
     backtrack when constraints are violated.

     A major and necessary improvement is to carefully select the order
     of the variables to instantiate, and also to carefully select the
     order of the values to try out.

     The method of constraint propagation means that each variable is
     a assigned an apriori set of values, and that each assignment
     leads to a subsequent elimination of all other assignment that
     becomes impossible. If it turns out that a variable can have no
     legal value, then the original assignement must be changed.


  Local Search for CSP


     The basic principle is to start with a random initial assignment,
     all the time keep an overview of the number of constraint violations,
     and then adjust locally the assignments that makes the biggest
     reduction in the conflict set.

     .....


TASK 3


3a)

     Starting with the top node, each possible move is depicted down
     to a maximum depth,or a terminal node (win or lose position).

     For the  nodes at the bottom level, each node is assigned an
     evalution function  value.

     The valuation function assigns  the values from the point of view
     of one of the players (called Max). The valuation function must
     give a top value to win position and a bottom value for a losing
     position, and and a value in between for non-terminal nodes.

     When that is done, all the values are backed up so that a Max
     node (Max to move) gets the maximum of its daughter nodes 
     ( Min-nodes), while each Min node gets the minimum value of its
     daughter nodes (Max nodes).

3b)

    The static value for B om the move could be - (minus) the value
    if A was in the move.

    The motivation for this evaluation function is twofold:

   i)  The game is symmetric, same rules for A and B.
       Positive values for A are  negative values for B and vice versa.

   ii) The  estimate f(S) gives the as the number of choices that
       the mover can do. The more possibilities, the more chance that a
       good move can be found if the games arrives at that position.

3c)

     Backed up values in ().

     Two double moves gives 5 levels of nodes.

3d)

     

     By alpha beta  pruning is meant a method whereby a node is not
     evaluated further if it can be proved that the node will never
     influence the choice. This is done  by assigning provisional
     values (alpha values at Max nodes, beta values at Min nodes
     when the a value is backed up from below.

        Alpha values can only be bigger, but if a Max node with an
        alpha value A  is below a Min node with a beta value B,
        and A > B, then B will never choose A anyway, and any further
        analysis of the subnodes will not change that.

    Benefits:

    Reduces the number of node expansion without sacrificing optimlaity.

    Alpha Beta prunig assumes that the nodes are evaluated depth first
    according to som ordering. If the ordering happens to be optimal
    (e.g. best values for Max appears first), then the 
    theoretical gain: is   N ** 1/2 where N is # nodes without  A-B
    This means that the depth can be doubled.

    The average gain:   N ** 3/4.
 


3e)

    (It is allowed to mark it on the figure above)


     The actual marking of the Alpha Beta cutoffs may vary according
     to the sequence of the evaluation of the subnodes).

     In the game tree above, A20 gets a backup value alpha value of 99
     early, which makes all node evaluations below B10 and B19 redundant.



TASK 4

     (The formalism to be used is specifically the Situation Calculus.
      Attempts to use other planning formalisms will not be honoured
      to full credit.)

    In the situation calculus, we can use the Reified Situation
    Calculus formulation.


            Holds(Condition,Situation)


    where Condition is one of the predications (Fluents) for the passenger


           AtLocation(Location,Time)

           InBus(BusID)


Situation is eithet a start situation Start, or 

   the result situation of applying an action A on a situation S, i.e.


          Result(S,Action)


The actions are


          Walk(Loc1,Loc2,StartTime,EndTime)

          Enter(BusID,Loc,Time)
 
          Leave(BusID,Loc,Time)

 
The axioms Passes and WalkingTime are here situation independent axioms

     A  set of consequence (effect) axioms may be 


     Holds(AtLoc(Loc2,Time),Result(Walk(Loc1,Loc2,StartTime,WalkTime),S)) <=
            Holds(AtLoc(Loc1,Time0),S),
            StartTime+WalkTime < Time.

     

     Holds(AtLoc(Loc2,Time),Result(Leave(BusId,Loc2,Time),S))  <=
            Holds(InBus(BusId),S),
            Passes(BusId,Loc2,Time).


  
     Holds(InBus(BusId),Result(Enter(BusID,Location,Time),S)) <=
             Holds(AtLoc(Location,Time),S),
             Passes(BusId,Location,Time).      


In general, a set of Frame axioms must be stated to say that some
properties stay invariant under various actions. As i happens, none
is actually needed here.

4b)


   This can be formulated as a problem for heuristic search.


      The states  are tuples  of (Location,InBus,Time)

      The successor functions are Walk, Enter and Leave according to
      the bus passing times

      The cost g is the the used time

      The heuristic h may or may not be available as route information
      (Shortest Airline Distances converted to times by maximum
      walking speed/ maximum bus speed). Otherwise, a trivial
      heuristic h=0 can be applied.

      An extra problem is that the optimisation to  be done is not
      just the shortest path (in time), but slightly more complex.

      A way of solving this is to start searching form the end goal,
      and search backwards in time. Then the first solution that
      reaches a start condition will be the wanted solution.

is inadequate, because PP means "Prepositional Phrase"
